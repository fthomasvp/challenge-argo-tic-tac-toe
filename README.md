# Argo Challenge: Tic Tac Toe


**Tic-Tac-Toe** is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, Player 1 (**X**) and Player 2 (**O**), who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.


## Requirements


- The game can be written in any programming language;

- The board must be applied to the user through the web interface or console;

- After each move the board must be updated on the screen;

- The system must not allow overlapping of moves, that is: a player cannot choose

a board position that has already been chosen in that game;

- At the end of the match, one of the following messages should be displayed:

	- "O Jogador 1 venceu!"

	- "O Jogador 2 venceu!"

	- "Deu Velha!"

- Display a scoreboard at the end of each match containing all the wins each player has;

- After displaying the end of game message, the player must have the option to restart a

new game or end the game.


## Setup Your Workspace


- Be sure to have **Java 11** installed;

- Choose the IDE of your preference. (_I used VS Code with [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)_)


## How To Play


### On Your IDE:

Open the project using your IDE and hit start!

### Playing:

You need to type a value for the line and column, beginning at 0 until 2.

> **0** refers to board **first position**.

> **1** refers to board **second position**.

> **2** refers to board **third position**.

This is the initial board:

For example, if you type the **line position** equals to **0** and the **column position** equals to **0**, this will be the result:
